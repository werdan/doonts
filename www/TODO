Major:

Add a media advice:
 - click on modal background closes it - should not
 - hit Enter on media - submiting form, should not
 - move focus to add media box on open

Search commit bug:
 - search for new role
 - create it
 - don't add advices
 - wait 60s
 - search this role again -> it should be in Solr


Minor:

Facebook Dialog Request is set with display=popup, but popup maybe blocked. Test page/iframe options (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/)
Page if facebook auth request is declined (+ remove user from list?)

Check that advice doesn't contain more than 280 chars

Use Solr synonims from WordNet : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2347
Add phonetic indexing to Solr
Delete .git from mongoose-fixtures
autoSuggest.css упаковать в styles.css
If not needed autocomplete - delete initialization from main.js
After login there is a redirection to URL with #=_= appended, this part should not be appended
Facebook app deauthorization handle
Remove LogEvent - replace it with logger level appenders
Characters typed better calculation on adding advice on Role page (1 Character(S) left)
Graceful stop of node cluster: http://www.subbu.org/blog/2012/01/cluster-example-with-node-0-6-x
